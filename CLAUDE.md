- React Query: use @tanstack/react-query to fetch data
- @mui/material: always use @mui/material library for the user interface
- Always memoize data when possible
- Never run npm start. Always assume the developer is running npm start in a terminal session.
- When fetching data, always validate the API calls by checking the API endpoint described with openapi.json in https://laxcoresrv.buck.local:8000/openapi.json
- If an API call is 'protected' use this header { 'x-token': 'a4taego8aerg;oeu;ghak1934570283465g23745693^$&%^$#$#^$#^#$nrghaoiughnoaergfo' } when fetching data
- Never use axios to fetch data.
- For deployment, use npm run build and the ./copy_to_lax.sh script
- Never create helper apps like those defined in srv/hooks/useApi.js.  Always fix or modify the Component or route requested by the user.
- Use a Grid layout with copmonents from the @mui/material library where possible.
- In Grid components, never use the sm, med, lg tags. They are deprecated. Always use the size tag instead.
- In Grid components, never use the item prop.  It is deprecated.
- Always check that a component used is imported in the file that it is referenced from.
- Always check api endpoints to see if they require the x-token header. If they do, use the protected api method to fetch data
- The api endpoint has cors set up properly. Always double-check cors errors to see if they are another type of error.
- Always add newly created components to the NavBar.
